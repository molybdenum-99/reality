        the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that [[Newtonian mechanics]]
        was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of [[classical mechanics]] with
        the laws of the [[electromagnetic field]]. This led to the development of
        his [[special theory of relativity]]. He realized, however, that the principle
        of relativity could also be extended to [[gravitational fields]], and with
        his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916, he published a paper on general
        relativity. He continued to deal with problems of [[statistical mechanics]]
        and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of [[particle]] theory and
        the [[Brownian motion|motion of molecules]]. He also investigated the thermal
        properties of light which laid the foundation of the [[photon]] theory of
        light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model
        the large-scale structure of the [[universe]].<ref name=Nobel>{{Citation |url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/advanced-physicsprize2011.pdf

        Einstein supported defending the Allied forces, but largely denounced the
        idea of using the newly discovered [[nuclear fission]] as a weapon. Later,
        with the British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], Einstein signed the [[Russell\u2013Einstein

        were [[Hermann Einstein]], a salesman and engineer, and [[Pauline Koch]].
        In 1880, the family moved to [[Munich]], where Einstein''s father and his
        uncle Jakob founded ''''Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein & Cie'''', a
        company that manufactured electrical equipment based on [[direct current]].<ref
        name=Bio />\n\nThe Einsteins were non-observant [[Ashkenazi Jews]], and Albert
        attended a [[Catholic school|Catholic elementary school]] in Munich from the
        age of 5 for three years. At the age of 8, he was transferred to the [[Luitpold
        Gymnasium]] (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received
        advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the [[German
        Empire]] seven years later.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA59
        59\u201361]}}\n\nIn 1894, Hermann and Jakob''s company lost a bid to supply
        the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital
        to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more
        efficient [[alternating current]] (AC) standard.<ref>Barry R. Parker, Einstein:
        The Passions of a Scientist, Prometheus Books - 2003, page 31</ref> The loss
        forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein
        family moved to Italy, first to [[Milan]] and a few months later to [[Pavia]].
        When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to finish his studies
        at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue [[electrical
        engineering]], but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school''s
        regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and
        creative thought was lost in strict [[rote learning]]. At the end of December
        1894, he travelled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school
        to let him go by using a doctor''s note.{{Sfnp|F\u00f6lsing|1997|pp=30\u201331}}
        During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title \"On the Investigation

        also published an essay, \"My First Impression of the U.S.A.,\" in July 1921,
        in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans, much

        of Einstein''s travels to the Far East, he was unable to personally accept
        the Nobel Prize for Physics at the Stockholm award ceremony in December 1922.
        In his place, the banquet speech was held by a German diplomat, who praised

        return voyage, he visited [[British Mandate for Palestine|Palestine]] for
        12 days in what would become his only visit to that region. Einstein was greeted
        as if he were a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon
        salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, [[Sir Herbert
        Samuel]]. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted
        to see and hear him. In Einstein''s talk to the audience, he expressed happiness

        America for the second time, originally intended as a two-month working visit
        as a research fellow at the [[California Institute of Technology]]. After
        the national attention he received during his first trip to the U.S., he and
        his arrangers aimed to protect his privacy. Although swamped with telegrams
        and invitations to receive awards or speak publicly, he declined them all.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=368}}\n\nAfter

        [[Carl Laemmle]], head of [[Universal Studios]], gave Einstein a tour of his
        studio and introduced him to Chaplin. They had an instant rapport, with Chaplin
        inviting Einstein and his wife, Elsa, to his home for dinner. Chaplin said

        Elsa telling him about the time Einstein conceived his [[theory of relativity]].
        During breakfast one morning, he seemed lost in thought and ignored his food.
        She asked him if something was bothering him. He sat down at his piano and
        started playing. He continued playing and writing notes for half an hour,
        then went upstairs to his study, where he remained for two weeks, with Elsa

        they learned that their cottage was raided by the Nazis and his personal sailboat

        and work, and equally worried about the fate of countless other scientists
        still in Germany. He rented a house in De Haan, Belgium, where he lived for
        a few months. In late July 1933, he went to England for about six weeks at
        the personal invitation of British naval officer Commander [[Oliver Locker-Lampson]],
        who had become friends with Einstein in the preceding years. To protect Einstein,
        Locker-Lampson had two assistants watch over him at his secluded cottage outside
        London, with the press publishing a photo of them guarding Einstein.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=422}}\n\nLocker-Lampson

        Earlier, in 1921, he was asked by the biochemist and president of the [[World
        Zionist Organization]], [[Chaim Weizmann]], to help raise funds for the planned
        university.{{Sfnp|Isaacson|2007|p=290}} He also submitted various suggestions
        as to its initial programs.\n\nAmong those, he advised first creating an Institute
        of Agriculture in order to settle the undeveloped land. That should be followed,
        he suggested, by a Chemical Institute and an Institute of Microbiology, to
        fight the various ongoing epidemics such as [[malaria]], which he called an

        that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with
        the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.<ref name=PubList

        This was understood by [[Hermann Minkowski]] to be a generalization of rotational
        invariance from space to space-time. Other principles postulated by Einstein

        of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of the quantum number.\n\n===

        and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciles [[Maxwell''s equations]]
        for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics, by introducing major
        changes to mechanics close to the [[speed of light]]. This later became known
        as Einstein''s [[special theory of relativity]].\n\nConsequences of this include

        effect. Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate (bottom), and eject
        electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.]]\n{{Main article|Photon|Quantum}}\nIn
        a 1905 paper,{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905a}} Einstein postulated that light itself
        consists of localized particles (''''[[quantum|quanta]]''''). Einstein''s
        light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including
        Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919,
        with [[Robert Millikan]]''s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect,
        and with the measurement of [[Compton scattering]].\n\nEinstein concluded
        that each wave of frequency ''''f'''' is associated with a collection of [[photon]]s
        with energy ''''hf'''' each, where ''''h'''' is [[Planck''s constant]]. He
        does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related
        to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental
        results, notably the photoelectric effect.{{sfnp|Einstein|1905a}}\n\n=== Quantized
        atomic vibrations ===\n{{Main article|Einstein solid}}\nIn 1907, Einstein
        proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent
        harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently\u2014a
        series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was
        aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be different,
        but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear
        demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem
        in classical mechanics. [[Peter Debye]] refined this model.<ref>[http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/nuggets/einstein/solidcolda.html

        variables ===\n{{Main article|Old quantum theory}}\nThroughout the 1910s,
        quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After
        [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit
        like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical
        postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the
        discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the [[periodic table of the elements]].\n\nEinstein
        contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments
        [[Wilhelm Wien]] had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of [[adiabatic
        invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of a thermal equilibrium state allows all
        the [[blackbody radiation|blackbody curves]] at different temperature to be
        derived from one another by a [[Wien''s displacement law|simple shifting process]].
        Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity
        which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant.
        [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] identified this adiabatic invariant as the [[action-angle

        Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became

        respects as independent, [[point particle|point-like particles]]. This paper
        introduced the ''''photon'''' concept (although the name ''''photon'''' was
        introduced later by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1926) and inspired the notion
        of [[wave\u2013particle duality]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. Einstein saw this

        controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the
        density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large
        fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths
        is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to
        [[Rayleigh scattering]], which is what happens when the fluctuation size is
        much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.<ref>{{cite

        \"second quantum theory.\" Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Albert
        Einstein and his assistant [[Otto Stern]]. Assuming the energy of rotating
        diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical
        specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched
        nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their
        support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea
        of zero-point energy.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 4: The Swiss Years: Writings,

        it, in a dark sky.|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Eddington]]''s
        photograph of a [[solar eclipse]]]]\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a [[theory
        of gravitation]] that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915.
        According to [[general relativity]], the observed gravitational attraction
        between masses results from the warping of [[spacetime|space and time]] by
        those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern
        [[astrophysics]]. It provides the foundation for the current understanding
        of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction is so
        strong that not even light can escape.\n\nAs Albert Einstein later said, the
        reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of
        inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a
        theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated
        ones) should appear more satisfactory.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1923}} Consequently,
        in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity.
        In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn
        from It\", he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that
        for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This
        argument is called the [[equivalence principle]]. In the same article, Einstein
        also predicted the phenomena of [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational
        red shift]] and [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=179-183}}{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol.
        2: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1900\u20131909|pp=273-274}}\n\nIn 1911, Einstein
        published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation
        of Light\" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount
        of [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]] by massive bodies. Thus,
        the theoretical prediction of general relativity can for the first time be
        tested experimentally.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=194-195}}\n\n====Gravitational waves====\nIn

        of [[spacetime]] which propagate as [[wave]]s, traveling outward from the
        source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational
        waves is possible under [[general relativity]] due to its [[Lorentz invariance]]
        which brings the concept of a finite speed of propagation of the physical
        interactions of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist
        in the [[Newton''s law of universal gravitation|Newtonian theory of gravitation]],
        which postulates that the physical interactions of gravity propagate at infinite

        article|Hole argument}}\nWhile developing general relativity, Einstein became
        confused about the [[gauge invariance]] in the theory. He formulated an argument
        that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible.
        He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched
        for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations
        only.\n\nIn June 1913, the Entwurf (\"draft\") theory was the result of these
        investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant
        and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented
        by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive
        work, Einstein realized that the [[hole argument]] was mistaken<ref>van Dongen,
        Jeroen (2010) ''''Einstein''s Unification'''' Cambridge University Press,
        p.23.</ref> and abandoned the theory in November 1915.\n\n=== Cosmology ===\n{{Main
        article|Cosmology}}\n{{cosmology|scientists}}\nIn 1917, Einstein applied the
        general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917a}}
        He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was
        dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a
        dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term,
        the [[cosmological constant]], to the field equations, in order to allow the
        theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted
        a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein''s understanding
        of [[Mach''s principle]] in these years.This model became known as the ''''''Einstein
        World'''''' or [[Einstein''s static universe]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1994|pp=285-286}}

        In a hitherto overlooked manuscript, apparently written in early 1931, Einstein
        explored a model of the expanding universe in which the density of matter
        remains constant due to a continuous creation of matter, a process he associated
        with the cosmological constant.<ref name=\"cor-steady-state\">O\u2019Raifeartaigh,

        As he stated in the paper, \"In what follows, I would like to draw attention
        to a solution to equation (1) that can account for Hubbel''s [sic] facts,
        and in which the density is constant over time\" ... \"If one considers a

        Einstein published an article in ''''Physikalische Zeitschrift'''' that proposed
        the possibility of [[stimulated emission]], the physical process that makes
        possible the [[maser]] and the [[laser]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917b}}\nThis article
        showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only
        be consistent with Planck''s distribution law if the emission of light into
        a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission
        of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the
        later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to
        show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws.\nEinstein
        discovered [[Louis de Broglie]]''s work, and supported his ideas, which were
        received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein
        gave a wave equation for [[Matter wave|de Broglie waves]], which Einstein
        suggested was the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]] of mechanics. This paper
        would inspire Schr\u00f6dinger''s work of 1926.\n\n=== Bose\u2013Einstein
        statistics ===\n{{Main article|Bose\u2013Einstein statistics}}\nIn 1924, Einstein
        received a description of a [[statistical mechanics|statistical]] model from
        Indian physicist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], based on a counting method that
        assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles.
        Einstein noted that Bose''s statistics applied to some atoms as well as to
        the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose''s paper
        to the ''''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]''''. Einstein also published his
        own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the [[Bose\u2013Einstein
        condensate]] phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1924}}
        It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally
        by [[Eric Allin Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] using [[ultracold atom|ultra-cooling]]
        equipment built at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]\u2013[[JILA]]

        Energy momentum pseudotensor ===\n{{Main article|Stress\u2013energy\u2013momentum
        pseudotensor}}\nGeneral relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is
        difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. [[Noether''s
        theorem]] allows these quantities to be determined from a [[Lagrangian (field
        theory)|Lagrangian]] with [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]],
        but [[general covariance]] makes translation invariance into something of
        a [[gauge symmetry]]. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity
        by Noether''s presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.\n\nEinstein
        argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational
        field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that
        the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description
        of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach
        has been echoed by [[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]], and others, and
        has become standard.\n\nThe use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors
        was heavily criticized in 1917 by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] and others.\n\n===
        Unified field theory ===\n{{Main article|Classical unified field theories}}\nFollowing
        his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts
        to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism
        as another aspect of a single entity. In 1950, he described his \"[[unified
        field theory]]\" in a ''''[[Scientific American]]'''' article entitled \"On
        the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\".{{Sfnp|Einstein|1950}} Although he
        continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated
        in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\nIn his pursuit
        of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream
        developments in physics, most notably the [[strong nuclear force|strong]]
        and [[weak nuclear force]]s, which were not well understood until many years
        after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein''s
        approaches to unification. Einstein''s dream of unifying other laws of physics
        with gravity motivates modern quests for a [[theory of everything]] and in
        particular [[string theory]], where geometrical fields emerge in a unified
        quantum-mechanical setting.\n\n=== Wormholes ===\n{{Main article|Wormhole}}\nEinstein
        collaborated with others to produce a model of a [[wormhole]]. His motivation
        was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational
        field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper \"Do Gravitational
        Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?\".
        These solutions cut and pasted [[Schwarzschild black hole]]s to make a bridge
        between two patches.\n\nIf one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the
        other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe
        that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.\n\n===
        Einstein\u2013Cartan theory ===\n{{Main article|Einstein\u2013Cartan theory}}\n[[File:Albert
        Einstein photo 1920.jpg|alt=Einstein, sitting at a table, looks up from the
        papers he is reading and into the camera.|thumb|upright|Einstein at his office,
        [[University of Berlin]], 1920]]In order to incorporate spinning point particles
        into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to
        include an antisymmetric part, called the [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]. This
        modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.\n\n=== Equations
        of motion ===\n{{Main article|Einstein\u2013Infeld\u2013Hoffmann equations}}\nThe
        theory of general relativity has a fundamental law\u2014the [[Einstein equations]]
        which describe how space curves, the [[geodesic equation]] which describes
        how particles move may be derived from the Einstein equations.\n\nSince the
        equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out
        of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory
        which is determined by the Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law.
        So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole,
        would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.\n\nThis
        was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without
        angular momentum, and by [[Roy Kerr]] for spinning objects.\n\n=== Other investigations
        ===\n{{Main article|Einstein''s unsuccessful investigations}}\nEinstein conducted
        other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to
        [[force]], [[superconductivity]], [[gravitational waves]], and other research.\n\n===
        Collaboration with other scientists ===\n[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|The
        1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels, a gathering of the world''s top physicists.
        Einstein is in the center.]]\nIn addition to longtime collaborators [[Leopold
        Infeld]], [[Nathan Rosen]], [[Peter Bergmann]] and others, Einstein also had
        some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.\n\n==== Einstein\u2013de
        Haas experiment ====\n{{Main article|Einstein\u2013de Haas effect}}\nEinstein
        and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons,
        nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization
        in an iron bar suspended on a [[torsion pendulum]]. They confirmed that this
        leads the bar to rotate, because the electron''s angular momentum changes
        as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because
        the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively
        established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.\n\n====
        Schr\u00f6dinger gas model ====\nEinstein suggested to Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger
        that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a [[Bose\u2013Einstein
        condensate|Bose\u2013Einstein gas]] by considering a box. Then to each possible
        quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator.
        Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number,
        which will be the number of particles in it.\n\nThis formulation is a form
        of [[second quantization]], but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin
        Schr\u00f6dinger applied this to derive the [[thermodynamic]] properties of
        a [[Quantum chaos|semiclassical]] [[ideal gas]]. Schr\u00f6dinger urged Einstein
        to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.<ref>{{Citation

        Einstein\u2013Podolsky\u2013Rosen paradox ===\n{{Main article|EPR paradox}}\nIn
        1935, Einstein returned to the question of quantum mechanics. He considered
        how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other.
        He noted, along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements
        on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties
        of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any
        way.\n\nHe then used a hypothesis of [[local realism]] to conclude that the
        other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed
        is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum
        measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the
        particle actually has values of position or momentum.\n\nThis principle distilled
        the essence of Einstein''s objection to quantum mechanics. As a physical principle,
        it was shown to be incorrect when the [[Aspect experiment]] of 1982 confirmed
        [[Bell''s theorem]], which had been promulgated in 1964.\n\n== Non-scientific
        legacy ==\nWhile traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted
        stepdaughters Margot and Ilse. The letters were included in the papers bequeathed
