        El nombre de Argentina]</ref>\n\nIn English the name \"Argentina\" probably
        comes from the [[Spanish language]], however the naming itself is not Spanish,
        but [[Italian language|Italian]]. ''''Argentina'''' ([[Grammatical gender|masculine]]
        ''''argentino'''') means in Italian \"(made) of silver, silver coloured\",
        probably borrowed from the  [[French language|Old French]] adjective ''''argentine''''
        \"(made) of silver\" > \"silver coloured\" already mentioned in the 12th century.<ref>[http://www.cnrtl.fr/etymologie/argentin
        Etymology of ''''argentin / -e'''' (French)]</ref> The French word ''''argentine''''
        is the [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] form of ''''argentin'''' and derives
        of ''''argent'''' \"silver\" with the [[suffix]] ''''-in'''' (same construction
        as Old French ''''acerin'''' \"(made) of steel\", from ''''acier'''' \"steel\"
        + ''''-in'''' or ''''sapin'''' \"(made) of fir wood\", from OF ''''sap''''
        \"fir\" + ''''-in''''). The Italian naming \"Argentina\" for the country implies
        ''''Argentina Terra'''' \"land of silver\" or ''''Argentina costa'''' \"coast
        of silver\". In Italian, the adjective or the [[proper noun]] is often used
        in an autonomous way as a substantive and replaces it and it is said ''''l''Argentina''''
        (It cannot be for the proper noun in French for example).\n\nThe name ''''Argentina''''
        was probably first given by the Venetian and Genoese navigators, such as [[Giovanni
        Caboto]]. In Spanish and Portuguese, the words for \"silver\" are respectively
        ''''plata'''' and ''''prata'''' and \"(made) of silver\" is said ''''plateado''''
        and ''''prateado''''. ''''Argentina'''' was first associated with the [[Sierra
        de la Plata|silver mountains legend]], widespread among the first European

        is still debated, however, as in some senses the long political war started

        Marxist paramilitary as early as 1969, and individual cases of [[state-sponsored
        terrorism]] against Peronism and the left can be traced back to the [[Bombing
        of Plaza de Mayo]] in 1955. The [[Trelew massacre]] of 1972, the actions of
        the [[Argentine Anticommunist Alliance]] since 1973, and [[Isabel Mart\u00ednez
        de Per\u00f3n]]''s \"annihilation decrees\" against left-wing guerrillas during
        ''''[[Operativo Independencia]]'''' (translates to Operation of Independence)
        in 1975, have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty
        War.\n\nOngan\u00eda shut down Congress, banned all political parties and
        dismantled student and worker unions. In 1969, popular discontent led to two
        massive protests: the ''''[[Cordobazo]]'''' and the ''''[[Rosariazo]]''''.

        in the Sciences. [[Bernardo Houssay]], the first Latin American among them,
        discovered the role of [[pituitary gland|pituitary hormones]] in regulating

        in [[metabolism|metabolizing]] [[carbohydrate]]s. Argentine research has led
        to the treatment of [[heart disease]]s and several forms of cancer. [[Domingo
        Liotta]] designed and developed the first [[artificial heart]] successfully
        implanted in a human being in 1969. [[Ren\u00e9 Favaloro]] developed the techniques

        1957 Argentina was the first country in Latin America to design and build
        a [[research reactor]] with homegrown technology, the [[RA-1 Enrico Fermi]].
        This reliance in the development of own nuclear related technologies, instead
        of simply buying them abroad, was a constant of Argentina''s nuclear programme
        conducted by the civilian [[National Atomic Energy Commission]] (CNEA). Nuclear
        facilities with Argentine technology have been built in Peru, Algeria, Australia
        and Egypt. In 1983, the country admitted having the capability of producing
        weapon-grade [[uranium]], a major step needed to assemble [[nuclear weapon]]s;
        since then, however, Argentina has pledged to use nuclear power only for peaceful

        to Viceroy [[Juan Jos\u00e9 de V\u00e9rtiz y Salcedo]]''s creation of the
        colony''s first theatre, ''''La Rancher\u00eda'''', in 1783. In this stage,
        in 1786, a tragedy entitled ''''Siripo'''' had its premiere. ''''Siripo''''
        is now a lost work (only the second act is conserved), and can be considered
        the first Argentine stage play, because it was written by Buenos Aires poet
        Manuel Jos\u00e9 de Lavard\u00e9n, it was premiered in Buenos Aires, and its
        plot was inspired by an historical episode of the early colonization of the
        [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin]]: the destruction of [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Sancti
        Spiritu]] colony by aboriginals in 1529. ''''La Rancher\u00eda'''' theatre
        operated until its destruction in a fire in 1792. The second theatre stage
        in Buenos Aires was [[Teatro Coliseo]], opened in 1804 during the term of
        Viceroy [[Rafael de Sobremonte]]. It was the nation''s longest-continuously
        operating stage. The musical creator of the Argentine National Anthem, [[Blas
        Parera]], earned fame as a theatre score writer during the early 19th century.
        The genre suffered during the regime of [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], though it
        flourished alongside the economy later in the century. The national government
        gave Argentine theatre its initial impulse with the establishment of the [[Col\u00f3n
        Theatre]], in 1857, which hosted classical and operatic, as well as stage
        performances. Antonio Petalardo''s successful 1871 gambit on the opening of
        the [[Teatro Opera]], inspired others to fund the growing art in Argentina.\n\n===Cinema===\n{{main
