        = South America|work= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]}}</ref> which is the
        model used in Spanish-speaking nations and most of South America. The reference
        to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern
        Cone) has relatively increased in the last decades, due to geopolitical dynamics
        (in particular, the rise of Brazil in the subcontinent).<ref name=\"academia.edu\">https://www.academia.edu/12944490/Unveiling_the_South_American_Balance</ref>\n\nIt
        is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and on the north and east
        by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; [[North America]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]] lie
        to the northwest. It includes twelve sovereign states \u2013 [[Argentina]],
        [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Guyana]],
        [[Paraguay]], [[Peru]], [[Suriname]], [[Uruguay]], and [[Venezuela]] \u2013
        and two non-sovereign areas \u2013 [[French Guiana]], an [[overseas department]]
        of [[France]], and the [[Falkland Islands]], a [[British Overseas Territory]]
        (though [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|disputed]] by Argentina). In
        addition to this, the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]] of the
        [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], and [[Panama]] may
        also be considered part of South America.\n\nSouth America has an [[area]]
        of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi). Its [[population]] {{As
        of|2005|lc=y}} has been estimated at more than 371,090,000. South America
        [[List of continents by population|ranks fourth]] in area (after [[Asia]],
        [[Africa]], and North America) and fifth in population (after Asia, Africa,
        [[Europe]], and North America). Brazil is by far the most populous South American
        country, with more than half of the continent''s population, followed by Colombia,
        Argentina, Venezuela and Peru.<ref>http://statisticstimes.com/population/south-american-countries-by-population.php</ref>
        In recent decades Brazil has also concentrated half of the region''s GDP and
        has become a first regional power.<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/>\n\nMost of
        the population lives near the continent''s western or eastern coasts while
        the interior and the [[patagonia|far south]] are sparsely populated. The geography
        of western South America is dominated by the [[Andes]] mountains; in contrast,
        the eastern part contains both highland regions and large lowlands where rivers
        such as the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], [[Orinoco]], and [[Paran\u00e1 River|Paran\u00e1]]
        flow. Most of the continent lies in the [[tropics]].\n\nThe continent''s cultural
        and ethnic outlook has its origin with the interaction of [[indigenous peoples
        of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] with European conquerors and immigrants
        and, more locally, with African slaves. Given a long [[European colonization
        of the Americas|history of colonialism]], the overwhelming majority of South
        Americans speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]],
        and societies and states commonly reflect [[Western culture|Western traditions]].\n\n==Geography==\n{{Main

        [[copper]], [[iron ore]], [[tin]], and [[petroleum]]. These resources found
        in South America have brought high income to its countries especially in times
        of war or of rapid economic growth by industrialized countries elsewhere.
        However, the concentration in producing one major export [[commodity]] often
        has hindered the development of diversified economies. The fluctuation in
        the price of commodities in the international markets has led historically
        to major highs and lows in the economies of South American states, often causing
        extreme political instability. This is leading to efforts to diversify production
        to drive away from staying as economies dedicated to one major export.\n\nSouth
        America is one of the most biodiverse continents on earth. South America is
        home to many interesting and unique species of animals including the [[llama]],
        [[anaconda]], [[piranha]], [[jaguar]], [[vicu\u00f1a]], and [[tapir]]. The
        Amazon rainforests possess high [[biodiversity]], containing a major proportion
        of the Earth''s [[species]].\n\nBrazil is the largest country in South America,
        encompassing around half of the continent''s land area and population. The
        remaining countries and territories are divided among three regions: The [[Andean
        States]], [[the Guianas]] and the [[Southern Cone]].\n\n===Outlying islands===\nTraditionally,
        South America also includes some of the nearby islands. [[Aruba]], [[Bonaire]],
        [[Cura\u00e7ao]], [[Trinidad]], [[Tobago]], and the [[federal dependencies
        of Venezuela]] sit on the northerly South American [[continental shelf]] and
        are often considered part of the continent. Geo-politically, the island states
        and overseas territories of the Caribbean are generally grouped as a part
        or subregion of North America, since they are more distant on the [[Caribbean
        Plate]], even though [[San Andr\u00e9s (island)|San Andres]] and [[Providencia
        Island|Providencia]] are politically part of [[Colombia]] and [[Aves Island]]
        is controlled by [[Venezuela]].<ref name=\"North America Atlas\"/><ref>[http://www.nationalgeographic.com/xpeditions/atlas/index.html?Parent=sameri&Rootmap=&Mode=d&SubMode=w

        islands that are included with South America are the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]]

        America is believed to have been joined with [[Africa]] from the late [[Paleozoic
        Era]] to the early [[Mesozoic Era]], until the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]]
        began to rift and break apart about 225 million years ago. Therefore, South
        America and Africa share similar fossils and rock layers.\n\nSouth America
        is thought to have been first inhabited by humans when people were crossing
        the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] (now the [[Bering Strait]]) at least 15,000
        years ago from the territory that is present-day [[Russia]]. They migrated
        south through [[North America]], and eventually reached South America through
        the [[Isthmus of Panama]].\n\nThe first evidence for the existence of the
        human race in South America dates back to about 9000 BC, when [[Squash (plant)|squashes]],
        [[chili pepper]]s and [[bean]]s began to be cultivated for food in the highlands
        of the [[Amazon Basin]]. Pottery evidence further suggests that [[manioc]],
        which remains a [[staple food]] today, was being cultivated as early as 2000
        BC.<ref name=\"OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas\">O''Brien, Patrick. (General Editor).
        Oxford Atlas of World History. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. pp.
        25</ref>\n\nBy 2000 BC, many [[agrarian society|agrarian]] communities had
        been settled throughout the [[Andes]] and the surrounding regions. Fishing
        became a widespread practice along the coast, helping establish fish as a
        primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time,
        which aided in the rise of an [[agrarian society]].<ref name=\"OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas\"/>\n\nSouth
        American cultures began domesticating [[llama]]s, [[vicu\u00f1a]]s, [[guanaco]]s,
        and [[alpaca]]s in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BC. Besides their
        use as sources of meat and wool, these animals were used for transportation
        of goods.<ref name=\"OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas\"/>\n\n===Pre-Columbian civilizations===\n\n{{Main

        is one of the [[New Seven Wonders of the World#Winners|New Seven Wonders of
        the World]]]]\n\nThe rise of plant growing and the subsequent appearance of
        permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings
        of civilizations in South America.\n\nOne of the earliest known South American
        civilizations was at [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], on the central
        [[Peru]]vian coast. Though a pre-ceramic culture, the monumental architecture
        of Norte Chico is contemporaneous with the pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt]].
        Norte Chico governing class established a trade network and developed agriculture
        then followed by [[Chavin culture|Chav\u00edn]] by 900 BC, according to some
        estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called
        [[Chav\u00edn de Huantar]] in modern Peru at an elevation of 3,177 meters.
        Chav\u00edn civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC.\n\nIn the central coast
        of Peru, around the beginning of the 1st millennium AD, [[Moche (culture)|Moche]]
        (100 BC&nbsp;\u2013 700 AD, at the northern coast of Peru), [[Paracas culture|Paracas]]
        and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] (400 BC&nbsp;\u2013 800 AD, Peru) cultures flourished
        with centralized states with permanent militia improving agriculture through
        [[irrigation]] and new styles of ceramic art. At the [[Altiplano]], Tiahuanaco
        or [[Tiwanaku]] (100 BC&nbsp;\u2013 1200 AD, Bolivia) managed a large commercial
        network based on religion.\n\nAround 7th century, both Tiahuanaco and Wari
        or [[Wari culture|Huari]] Empire (600\u20131200, Central and northern Peru)
        expanded its influence to all the Andean region, imposing the Huari urbanism
        and tiahuanaco religious iconography.\n\nThe [[Muisca people|Muisca]] were
        the main indigenous civilization in what is now Colombia. They established
        the [[Muisca Confederation]] of many clans, or ''''[[cacique|cacicazgos]]'''',
        that had a free trade network among themselves. They were goldsmiths and farmers.\n\nOther
        important Pre-Columbian cultures include: the [[Ca\u00f1ari]]s (in south central
        Ecuador), [[Chim\u00fa]] Empire (1300\u20131470, Peruvian northern coast),
        [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and the Aymaran kingdoms (1000\u20131450,
        Bolivia and southern Peru).\n\nHolding their capital at the great city of
        [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438
        to 1533. Known as ''''Tawantin suyu'''', and \"the land of the four regions,\"
        in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the Inca civilization was highly distinct
        and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic
        communities, some 9 to 14 million people connected by a 25,000 kilometer [[Inca
        road system|road system]]. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework,
        constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was
        a useful form of agriculture.\n\nThe [[Mapuche]] in Central and Southern Chile
        resisted the European and Chilean settlers, waging the [[Arauco War]] for
        more than 300 years.\n\n===European colonization===\n{{Main article|Spanish
        colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Oscar
        Pereira da Silva - Desembarque de Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral em Porto Seguro

        era.]]\n[[Image:Inca-Spanish confrontation.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Spanish conquest
        of the Inca Empire|Inca\u2013Spanish confrontation]] in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]]
        left thousands of natives dead.]]\n\nIn 1494, [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]],
        the two great maritime European powers of that time, on the expectation of
        new lands being discovered in the west, signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]],
        by which they agreed, with the support of the Pope, that all the land outside
        Europe should be an exclusive [[duopoly]] between the two countries.\n\nThe
        treaty established an imaginary line along a north-south [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]
        370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde Islands]], roughly
        46\u00b0 37'' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line
        (known to comprise most of the South American soil) would belong to Spain,
        and all land to the east, to Portugal. As accurate measurements of [[longitude]]
        were impossible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting
        in a [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese expansion of Brazil]]
        across the meridian.\n\nBeginning in the 1530s, the people and natural resources
        of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign [[conquistadors]], first
        from Spain and later from Portugal. These competing colonial nations claimed
        the land and resources as their own and divided it in colonies.\n\nEuropean
        infectious diseases ([[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], and [[typhus]])
        \u2013 to which the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native populations]]
        had no immune resistance&nbsp;\u2013  caused large-scale depopulation of the
        native population under Spanish control. Systems of forced labor, such as
        the [[hacienda]]s and mining industry''s [[Mita (Inca)|mit''a]] also contributed
        to the depopulation. After this, African [[Slavery|slaves]], who had developed
        immunities to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them.\n\nThe
        Spaniards were committed to convert their native subjects to [[Christianity]]
        and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end;
        however, many initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as
        native groups simply blended [[Catholicism]] with their established beliefs
        and practices. Furthermore, the Spaniards brought their language to the degree
        they did with their religion, although the [[Roman Catholic Church]]''s evangelization
        in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and [[Guaran\u00ed
        language|Guaran\u00ed]] actually contributed to the continuous use of these
        native languages albeit only in the oral form.\n\nEventually, the [[Indigenous
        peoples of the Americas|natives]] and the Spaniards interbred, forming a [[mestizo]]
        class. At the beginning, many mestizos of the Andean region were offspring
        of Amerindian mothers and Spanish fathers. After independence, most mestizos
        had native fathers and European or mestizo mothers.\n\nMany native artworks
        were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers; this included
        many gold and silver sculptures and other artifacts found in South America,
        which were melted down before their transport to Spain or Portugal. Spaniards
        and Portuguese brought the western European architectural style to the continent,
        and helped to improve infrastructures like bridges, roads, and the sewer system
        of the cities they discovered or conquered. They also significantly increased
        economic and trade relations, not just between the old and new world but between
        the different South American regions and peoples. Finally, with the expansion
        of the Portuguese and Spanish languages, many cultures that were previously
        separated became united through that of [[Latin America]]n.\n\n[[Guyana]]
        was first a Dutch, and then a [[British Empire|British colony]], though there
        was a brief period during the Napoleonic Wars when it was colonized by the
        French. The country was once partitioned into three parts, each being controlled
        by one of the colonial powers until the country was finally taken over fully
        by the British.\n\n[[File:Plaza de San Francisco en Centro hist\u00f3rico

        also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Atlantic slave trade}}\n\nIndigenous
        peoples of the Americas in various European colonies were forced to work in
        European plantations and mines; along with African slaves who were also introduced
        in the proceeding centuries.\n\n===Independence from Spain and Portugal===\n{{Main
        article|Spanish American wars of independence|Independence of Brazil}}\n[[File:Entrevista
        de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Guayaquil conference]], between [[Jos\u00e9
        de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]].]]\nThe European [[Peninsular
        War]] (1807\u20131814), a theater of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], changed the
        political situation of both the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. First, Napoleon
        invaded Portugal, but the [[House of Braganza]] avoided capture by [[Transfer
        of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|escaping to Brazil]]. Napoleon also captured
        King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], and appointed his own brother instead. This
        appointment provoked severe popular resistance, which created [[Junta (Peninsular
        War)|Juntas]] to rule in the name of the captured king.\n\nMany cities in
        the Spanish colonies, however, considered themselves equally authorized to
        appoint local Juntas like those of Spain. This began the [[Spanish American
        wars of independence]] between the [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriots]],
        who promoted such autonomy, and the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]],
        who supported Spanish authority over the Americas. The Juntas, in both Spain
        and the Americas, promoted the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].
        Five years after the beginning of the war, Ferdinand VII returned to the throne
        and began the [[Absolutist Restoration]] as the royalists got the upper hand
        in the conflict.\n\nThe independence of South America was secured by [[Sim\u00f3n
        Bol\u00edvar]] (Venezuela) and [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] (Argentina),
        the two most important ''''[[Libertadores]]''''. Bol\u00edvar led a great
        uprising in the north, then led his army southward towards [[Lima]], the capital
        of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Meanwhile, San Mart\u00edn led an army across
        the Andes Mountains, along with Chilean expatriates, and liberated Chile.
        He organized a fleet to reach Peru by sea, and sought the military support
        of various rebels from the Viceroyalty of Peru. The two armies finally met
        in Guayaquil, [[Ecuador]], where they cornered the Royal Army of the Spanish
        Crown and forced its surrender.\n\nIn the Portuguese kingdom of Brazil and
        Algarve, [[Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese
        King [[Dom Jo\u00e3o VI]], proclaimed the independent Kingdom of Brazil in
        1822, which later became the [[Empire of Brazil]]. Despite the Portuguese
        loyalties of garrisons in [[Bahia]] and [[Par\u00e1]], independence was diplomatically
        accepted by the crown in Portugal, on condition of a high compensation paid
        by Brazil.\n\n===Nation-building and balkanization===\nThe newly independent
        nations began a process of [[balkanization]], with several civil and international
        wars. However, it was not as strong as in Central America. Some countries
        created from provinces of larger countries stayed as such up to modern day
        (such as Paraguay or Uruguay), while others were reconquered and reincorporated
        into their former countries (such as the [[Republic of Entre R\u00edos]] and
        the [[Riograndense Republic]]).\n\nThe [[Peru\u2013Bolivian Confederation]],
        a short-lived union of Peru and Bolivia, was blocked by Chile in the [[War
        of the Confederation]] (1836\u20131839) and again during the [[War of the
        Pacific]] (1879\u20131883). Paraguay was virtually destroyed by Argentina
        and Brazil in the [[Paraguayan War]].\n\n===Rise and fall of military dictatorships===\n[[File:Brazilian

        and Peru-Ecuador fighting the last inter-state wars.\nEarly in the 20th century,
        the [[ABC Powers|three wealthiest South American countries]] engaged in [[South
        American dreadnought race|a vastly expensive naval arms race]] which was catalyzed
        by the introduction of a new warship type, the \"[[dreadnought]]\". At one
        point, the Argentine government was spending a fifth of its entire yearly
        budget for just two dreadnoughts, a price that did not include later in-service
        costs, which for the Brazilian dreadnoughts was sixty percent of the initial
        purchase.<ref>Richard Hough, ''''The Big Battleship'''' (London: Michael Joseph,

        a battlefield of the [[Cold War]] in the late 20th century. Some democratically
        elected governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay were
        overthrown or displaced by military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s.
        To curtail opposition, their governments detained tens of thousands of [[political
        prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed on [[Operation Condor|inter-state
        collaboration]]. Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic
        policies. They placed their own actions within the US Cold War doctrine of
        \"National Security\" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and
        1990s, Peru suffered from [[Internal conflict in Peru|an internal conflict]].\n\nArgentina
        and Britain fought the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.\n\nColombia has had an ongoing,
        though diminished internal conflict, which started in 1964 with the creation
        of [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] (FARC-EP) and then
        involved several illegal armed groups of leftist-leaning ideology as well
        as the private armies of powerful drug lords. Many of these are now defunct,
        and only a small portion of the ELN remains, along with the stronger, though
        also greatly reduced FARC. These leftist groups smuggle narcotics out of Colombia
        to fund their operations, while also using kidnapping, bombings, land mines
        and assassinations as weapons against both elected and non-elected citizens.\n\n[[File:Presidentes

        and right-wing military dictatorships became common after [[World War II]],
        but since the 1980s, a wave of democratization came through the continent,

        to the political left, with leftist leaders being elected in Chile, Uruguay,

        peoples, the historic connection with the Iberian Peninsula and Africa, and
        waves of immigrants from around the globe.\n\nSouth American nations have
        a rich variety of [[Latin American music|music]]. Some of the most famous
        genres include [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] from Colombia, [[pasillo]] from
        Ecuador, [[samba]], [[bossa nova]] and [[m\u00fasica sertaneja]] from Brazil,
        and [[tango music|tango]] from Argentina and Uruguay. Also well known is the
        non-commercial folk genre [[Nueva Canci\u00f3n]] movement which was founded
        in Argentina and Chile and quickly spread to the rest of the Latin America.
        People on the Peruvian coast created the fine [[guitar]] and [[cajon]] duos
        or trios in the most [[mestizo]] (mixed) of South American rhythms such as
        the Marinera (from Lima), the [[Tondero]] (from Piura), the 19th century popular
        Creole Valse or Peruvian Valse, the soulful Arequipan Yaravi, and the early
        20th century Paraguayan [[Guarania (music)|Guarania]]. In the late 20th century,
        [[Rock en Espa\u00f1ol|Spanish rock]] emerged by young hipsters influenced
        by British pop and American rock. [[Music of Brazil|Brazil]] has a Portuguese-language
        pop rock industry as well a great variety of other music genres.\n\nThe [[Spanish
        American literature|literature]] of South America has attracted considerable
        critical and popular acclaim, especially with the [[Latin American Boom]]
        of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of authors such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]],
        [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] in novels and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and
        [[Pablo Neruda]] in other genres. The Brazilians [[Machado de Assis]] and
        [[Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa]] are widely regarded as the greatest Brazilian
        writers.\n\nBecause of South America''s broad ethnic mix, [[South American
        cuisine]] has African, South American Indian, Asian, and European influences.
        [[Bahia]], Brazil, is especially well known for its West African\u2013influenced
        cuisine. Argentines, Chileans, Uruguayans, Brazilians, Bolivians, and Venezuelans
        regularly consume wine. Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and people in southern
        Chile, Bolivia and Brazil drink [[mate (beverage)|mate]], a herb which is
        brewed. The Paraguayan version, [[terere]], differs from other forms of mate
        in that it is served cold. [[Pisco]] is a liquor distilled from grapes in
        Peru and Chile. Peruvian cuisine mixes elements from Chinese, Japanese, Spanish,
        African, Andean, and Amazonic food.\n\n===Language===\n[[File:Languages of

        in Bolivia, Peru, and less often in Chile; and [[Mapudungun]] is spoken in
        certain pockets of southern Chile and, more rarely, Argentina. At least three
        South American indigenous languages (Quechua, Aymara, and Guarani) are recognized
        along with Spanish as national languages.\n\nOther languages found in South
        America include, Hindi and [[Javanese language|Javanese]] in Suriname; [[Italian
        language|Italian]] in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela and Chile; and
        [[German language|German]] in certain pockets of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.
        German is also spoken in many regions of the southern states of Brazil, [[Riograndenser
        Hunsr\u00fcckisch]] being the most widely spoken German dialect in the country;
        among other Germanic dialects, a Brazilian form of [[Pomeranian language|Pomeranian]]
        is also well represented and is experiencing a revival. [[Welsh language|Welsh]]
        remains spoken and written in the historic towns of [[Trelew]] and [[Rawson,
        Chubut|Rawson]] in the Argentine [[Patagonia]]. There are also small clusters
        of [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-speakers in Brazil, Colombia and Peru. Arabic
        speakers, often of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Syrian people|Syrian]],
