        From this period onwards, Europe played a predominant role in global affairs.
        Between the 16th and 20th centuries, European nations controlled at various

        [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain
        and Ireland|United Kingdom]] at the end of the 18th century, gave rise to
        radical economic, cultural, and social change in Western Europe, and eventually
        the wider world. Both [[world war]]s were largely focused upon Europe, contributing
        to a decline in [[Western Europe]]an dominance in world affairs by the mid-20th

        took the [[Tanais]] (the modern Don River) as the boundary.\n\nThe term \"Europe\"

        the 9th century. From that time, the term designated the sphere of influence

        the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], Europe entered a long period of change
        arising from what historians call the \"[[Age of Migrations]]\". There were
        numerous invasions and migrations amongst the [[Ostrogoths]], [[Visigoths]],
        [[Goths]], [[Vandals]], [[Huns]], [[Franks]], [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], [[Slavs]],
        [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Bulgars]] and, later on, the [[Vikings]], [[Pechenegs]],

        Isolated monastic communities were the only places to safeguard and compile
        written knowledge accumulated previously; apart from this very few written
        records survive and much literature, philosophy, mathematics, and other thinking
        from the classical period disappeared from Western Europe though they were
        preserved in the east, in the Byzantine Empire.<ref>[[Norman Cantor|Norman
        F. Cantor]], ''''The Medieval World 300 to 1300''''.</ref>\n\nWhile the Roman
        empire in the west continued to decline, Roman traditions and the Roman state
        remained strong in the predominantly Greek-speaking [[Eastern Roman Empire]],
        also known as the [[Byzantine Empire]].  During most of its existence, the
        Byzantine Empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force
        in Europe.  Emperor [[Justinian I]] presided over Constantinople''s first
        golden age: he established a [[Code of Justinian|legal code]] that forms the
        basis of many modern legal systems, funded the construction of the [[Hagia
        Sophia]], and brought the Christian church under state control.<ref name=\"natgeo

        [[Arabs]] started to encroach on historically Roman territory. As the Byzantines
        and neighbouring [[Sasanids|Sasanid Persians]] were severely weakened by the
        time due the protracted, centuries-lasting and frequent [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian
        wars]], the Muslims entirely toppled the Sasanids, and made inroads into Byzantine
        [[Asia Minor]]. In the mid 7th century AD, following the [[Muslim conquest
        of Persia]], Islam penetrated into the [[Caucasus]] region.<ref>{{cite book

        [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732, which
        ended their northward advance.\n\nDuring the Dark Ages, the [[Western Roman
        Empire]] fell under the control of various tribes. The Germanic and Slav tribes
        established their domains over Western and Eastern Europe respectively.<ref

        Central Europe]] saw the creation of the first Slavic states and the adoption
        of [[Christianity]] (circa 1000 AD). The powerful [[West Slavs|West Slavic]]

        reaching its largest territorial extent under [[Svatopluk I of Moravia|Svatopluk

        south, the first [[South Slavs|South Slavic states]] emerged in the late 7th
        and 8th century and adopted [[Christianity]]: the [[First Bulgarian Empire]],
        the [[Principality of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian Principality]] (later [[Serbian
        Kingdom|Kingdom]] and [[Serbian Empire|Empire]]), and the [[Duchy of Croatia]]
        (later [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Kingdom of Croatia]]). To the
        East, the [[Kievan Rus]] expanded from its capital in [[Kiev]] to become the
        largest state in Europe by the 10th century. In 988, [[Vladimir the Great]]

        as the [[High Middle Ages]], during which the population of Europe experienced
        significant growth, culminating in the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]].  Economic
        growth, together with the lack of safety on the mainland trading routes, made
        possible the development of major commercial routes along the coast of the
        [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Baltic Sea]]s. The growing wealth
        and independence acquired by some coastal cities gave the [[Maritime Republics]]
        a leading role in the European scene.\n\n[[File:Philip II and Tancred meeting

        (1189\u20131192)]]\n\nThe Middle Ages on the mainland were dominated by the
        two upper echelons of the social structure: the nobility and the clergy. [[Feudalism]]
        developed in [[France]] in the Early Middle Ages and soon spread throughout
        Europe.<ref name=\"natgeo 158\">National Geographic, 158.</ref> A struggle

        culture in this period came from the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Through monasteries
        and cathedral schools, the Church was responsible for education in much of
        Europe.<ref name=\"natgeo 158\" />\n\nThe [[Papacy]] reached the height of
        its power during the High Middle Ages. An [[East-West Schism]] in 1054 split
        the former Roman Empire religiously, with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]
        in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the Roman Catholic Church in the former Western
        Roman Empire. In 1095 [[Pope Urban II]] called for a [[Crusades|crusade]]
        against [[Muslims]] occupying [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Holy Land]].<ref name=\"natgeo

        the [[Inquisition]] against heretics. In [[Spain]], the [[Reconquista]] concluded

        great variation within relatively small areas. The southern regions are more
        mountainous, while moving north the terrain descends from the high [[Alps]],
        [[Pyrenees]], and [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], through hilly uplands,
        into broad, low northern plains, which are vast in the east. This extended
        lowland is known as the [[Great European Plain]], and at its heart lies the
        [[North German Plain]]. An arc of uplands also exists along the north-western
        seaboard, which begins in the western parts of the islands of [[Great Britain|Britain]]
        and [[Ireland]], and then continues along the mountainous, fjord-cut spine
        of Norway.\n\nThis description is simplified. Sub-regions such as the [[Iberian
        Peninsula]] and the [[Italian Peninsula]] contain their own complex features,
        as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus,
        river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like
        [[Iceland]], Britain, and Ireland are special cases. The former is a land
        unto itself in the northern ocean which is counted as part of Europe, while
        the latter are upland areas that were once joined to the mainland until rising
        sea levels cut them off.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of Europe}}\n[[File:Vegetation

        central heating\", because it makes Europe''s climate warmer and wetter than
        it would otherwise be. The Gulf Stream not only carries warm water to Europe''s
        coast but also warms up the prevailing westerly winds that blow across the
        continent from the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nTherefore, the average temperature throughout
        the year of Naples is 16&nbsp;\u00b0C (60.8&nbsp;\u00b0F), while it is only
        12&nbsp;\u00b0C (53.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in New York City which is almost on the

        average around 8&nbsp;\u00b0C (15&nbsp;\u00b0F) higher than those in Calgary,
        and they are almost 22&nbsp;\u00b0C (40&nbsp;\u00b0F) higher than average
        temperatures in Irkutsk.<ref name=\"climate\" /> Similarly, northern parts
        of Scotland have a tempertate marine climate. The yearly average temperature

        Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, is on roughly the same latitude and has an average

        of Europe traces back to the formation of the [[Baltic Shield]] (Fennoscandia)
        and the [[Sarmatian craton]], both around 2.25&nbsp;billion years ago, followed
        by the [[Volgo\u2013Uralia]] shield, the three together leading to the [[East
        European craton]] (\u2248 [[Baltica]]) which became a part of the [[supercontinent]]
        [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]]. Around 1.1&nbsp;billion years ago,
        Baltica and Arctica (as part of the [[Laurentia]] block) became joined to
        [[Rodinia]], later resplitting around 550&nbsp;million years ago to reform
        as Baltica. Around 440&nbsp;million years ago [[Euramerica]] was formed from
        Baltica and Laurentia; a further joining with [[Gondwana]] then leading to
        the formation of [[Pangea]]. Around 190&nbsp;million years ago, Gondwana and
        [[Laurasia]] split apart due to the widening of the Atlantic Ocean. Finally,
        and very soon afterwards, Laurasia itself split up again, into Laurentia (North
        America) and the Eurasian continent. The land connection between the two persisted
        for a considerable time, via [[Greenland]], leading to interchange of animal
        species. From around 50&nbsp;million years ago, rising and falling sea levels
        have determined the actual shape of Europe, and its connections with continents
        such as Asia. Europe''s present shape dates to the late [[Tertiary period]]

        plain ranging from Ireland in the west to the [[Ural Mountains]] in the east.
        These two halves are separated by the mountain chains of the [[Pyrenees]]
        and [[Alps]]/[[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]]. The northern plains are
        delimited in the west by the [[Scandinavian Mountains]] and the mountainous
        parts of the British Isles. Major shallow water bodies submerging parts of
        the northern plains are the [[Celtic Sea]], the [[North Sea]], the [[Baltic

        in the south and west constitute fragments from various other geological continents.
        Most of the older geology of western Europe existed as part of the ancient
        [[microcontinent]] [[Avalonia]].\n\n===Flora===\n\nHaving lived side-by-side
        with agricultural peoples for millennia, Europe''s animals and plants have
        been profoundly affected by the presence and activities of man. With the exception
        of [[Fennoscandia]] and northern Russia, few areas of untouched wilderness
        are currently found in Europe, except for various [[national park]]s.\n\n[[File:Europe
        land use map.png|thumb|left|Land use map of Europe with arable farmland (yellow),
        forest (dark green), pasture (light green), and tundra or bogs in the north
        (dark yellow)]]\n\nThe main natural vegetation cover in Europe is mixed [[forest]].
        The conditions for growth are very favourable. In the north, the [[Gulf Stream]]
        and [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] warm the continent. Southern
        Europe could be described as having a warm, but mild climate. There are frequent
        summer droughts in this region. Mountain ridges also affect the conditions.
        Some of these ([[Alps]], [[Pyrenees]]) are oriented east-west and allow the
        wind to carry large masses of water from the ocean in the interior. Others
        are oriented south-north ([[Scandinavian Mountains]], [[Dinaric Alps|Dinarides]],
        [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]], [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]) and
        because the rain falls primarily on the side of mountains that is oriented
        towards the sea, forests grow well on this side, while on the other side,
        the conditions are much less favourable. Few corners of mainland Europe have
        not been grazed by [[livestock]] at some point in time, and the cutting down
        of the pre-agricultural forest habitat caused disruption to the original plant
        and animal ecosystems.\n\n[[File:Floristic regions in Europe (english).png|thumb|Floristic
        regions of Europe and neighbouring areas, according to Wolfgang Frey and Rainer
        L\u00f6sch]]\n\nProbably 80 to 90 percent of Europe was once covered by forest.<ref>{{cite
        web|url=http://www.saveamericasforests.org/europages/history&geography.htm|title=History

        It stretched from the Mediterranean Sea to the Arctic Ocean. Though over half
        of Europe''s original forests disappeared through the centuries of [[deforestation]],
        Europe still has over one quarter of its land area as forest, such as the
        [[taiga]] of Scandinavia and Russia, mixed [[rainforest]]s of the Caucasus
        and the [[Cork oak]] forests in the western Mediterranean. During recent times,
        deforestation has been slowed and many trees have been planted. However, in
        many cases monoculture [[plantation]]s of [[Pinophyta|conifers]] have replaced
        the original mixed natural forest, because these grow quicker. The plantations
        now cover vast areas of land, but offer poorer habitats for many European
        forest dwelling species which require a mixture of tree species and diverse
        forest structure. The amount of natural forest in Western Europe is just 2\u20133%
        or less, in European Russia 5\u201310%. The country with the smallest percentage
        of forested area is [[Iceland]] (1%), while the most forested country is Finland
        (77%).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcpfe.net/system/files/u1/publications/pdf/state_of_europes_forests_2007.pdf

        both [[flowering plant|broadleaf]] and coniferous trees dominate. The most
        important species in central and western Europe are [[beech]] and [[oak]].
        In the north, the taiga is a mixed [[spruce]]\u2013[[pine]]\u2013[[birch]]
        forest; further north within Russia and extreme northern Scandinavia, the
        taiga gives way to [[tundra]] as the Arctic is approached. In the Mediterranean,
        many [[olive]] trees have been planted, which are very well adapted to its
        arid climate; [[Cupressus sempervirens|Mediterranean Cypress]] is also widely
        planted in southern Europe. The semi-arid Mediterranean region hosts much
        scrub forest. A narrow east-west tongue of Eurasian [[grassland]] (the [[steppe]])
        extends eastwards from [[Ukraine]] and southern Russia and ends in Hungary
        and traverses into taiga to the north.\n\n===Fauna===\n{{main|Fauna of Europe}}\n[[File:Europe

        of Europe and bordering regions]]\n\nGlaciation during the [[Quaternary glaciation|most
        recent ice age]] and the presence of man affected the distribution of [[Fauna
        of Europe|European fauna]]. As for the animals, in many parts of Europe most
        large animals and top [[predator]] species have been hunted to extinction.
        The [[woolly mammoth]] was extinct before the end of the [[Neolithic]] period.
        Today [[wolf|wolves]] ([[carnivore]]s) and [[bear]]s ([[omnivore]]s) are endangered.
        Once they were found in most parts of Europe. However, deforestation and hunting
        caused these animals to withdraw further and further. By the [[Middle Ages]]
        the bears'' habitats were limited to more or less inaccessible mountains with
        sufficient forest cover. Today, the [[European brown bear|brown bear]] lives
        primarily in the [[Balkan|Balkan peninsula]], Scandinavia, and Russia; a small
        number also persist in other countries across Europe (Austria, Pyrenees etc.),
        but in these areas brown bear populations are fragmented and marginalised
        because of the destruction of their habitat. In addition, [[polar bear]]s
        may be found on [[Svalbard]], a Norwegian archipelago far north of Scandinavia.
        The [[Eurasian wolf|wolf]], the second largest predator in Europe after the
        brown bear, can be found primarily in [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and in
        the Balkans, with a handful of packs in pockets of [[Western Europe]] (Scandinavia,
        Spain, etc.).\n\n[[File:Neandertal - Wisent.jpg|thumb|Once roaming the great

        for the EU and increasing cross border trade. This helped them to enjoy rapidly
        improving economies, while those states in COMECON were struggling in a large
        part due to the cost of the [[Cold War]]. Until 1990, the [[European Community]]
        was expanded from 6 founding members to 12. The emphasis placed on resurrecting
        the West German economy led to it overtaking the UK as Europe''s largest economy.\n\n;Reunification

        the post-socialist states began free market reforms: Poland, Hungary, and
        [[Slovenia]] adopted them reasonably quickly, while [[Ukraine]] and Russia
        are still in the process of doing so.\n\nAfter [[East Germany|East]] and West
        Germany were reunited in 1990, the economy of West Germany struggled as it
        had to support and largely rebuild the infrastructure of East Germany.\nBy
        the millennium change, the EU dominated the economy of Europe comprising the
        five largest European economies of the time namely Germany, the United Kingdom,
        France, Italy, and Spain. In 1999, 12 of the 15 members of the EU joined the
        [[Eurozone]] replacing their former national currencies by the common euro.

        but there are significant minorities, such as the [[White South African]]s.

        of Europe}}\n[[File:Simplified Languages of Europe map.svg|thumb|Overview
        map of the distribution of major European languages]]\n\nEuropean languages
        mostly fall within three [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language
        groups: the [[Romance languages]], derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]]
        of the [[Roman Empire]]; the [[Germanic languages]], whose ancestor language
        came from southern Scandinavia; and the [[Slavic languages]].<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia
        Britannica\" />\n\nSlavic languages are most spoken by the number of native
        speakers in Europe, they are spoken in Central, Eastern, and Southeastern
        Europe. Romance languages are spoken primarily in south-western Europe as
        well as in [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]], in Central or Eastern Europe. Germanic
        languages are spoken in Northern Europe, the British Isles and some parts
        of [[Central Europe]].<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" />\n\nMany
        other languages outside the three main groups exist in Europe. Other Indo-European
        languages include the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] group (that is, [[Latvian
        language|Latvian]] and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]]), the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]]
        group (that is, [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Scots Gaelic language|Scottish
        Gaelic]], [[Manx language|Manx]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]],
        and [[Breton language|Breton]]<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\" />),
        [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], and [[Albanian language|Albanian]].
        In addition, a distinct group of [[Uralic languages]] ([[Estonian language|Estonian]],
        [[Finnish language|Finnish]], and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]) is spoken
        mainly in [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], and [[Hungary]], while [[Kartvelian languages]]
        ([[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]], and [[Svan
        language|Svan]]), are spoken primarily in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and
        two other language families reside in the North Caucasus (termed [[Northeast
        Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian]], most notably including [[Chechen
        language|Chechen]], [[Avar language|Avar]] and [[Lezgian language|Lezgin]]
        and [[Northwest Caucasian languages|Northwest Caucasian]], notably including
        [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]]). [[Maltese language|Maltese]] is the only [[Semitic
        language]] that is official within the EU, while [[Basque language|Basque]]
        is the only European [[language isolate]]. [[Turkic languages]] include [[Azerbaijani
        language|Azerbaijani]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]], in addition to the
        [[Languages of Russia|languages of minority nations]] in Russia.\n\nMultilingualism
        and the protection of regional and minority languages are recognised political
        goals in Europe today. The [[Council of Europe]] [[Framework Convention for
        the Protection of National Minorities]] and the Council of Europe''s [[European
        Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] set up a legal framework for
        language rights in Europe.\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Europe}}\n[[File:Europe

        religions (though Tibetan Buddhism is the majority religion of Russia''s [[Republic

        cultures; cultural mixes exist across the continent. Scholar Andreas Kaplan
        describes Europe as \"embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical

        There are cultural [[innovation]]s and movements, sometimes at odds with each
        other. Thus, the question of \"common culture\" or \"common values\" is complex.\n\nAccording
        to historian [[Hilaire Belloc]], for several centuries the peoples of Europe
        based their self-identification on the remaining traces of the [[Culture of
        ancient Rome|Roman culture]] and on the concept of [[Christendom]], because
        many European-wide military alliances were of religious nature: the [[Crusades]]
        (1095\u20131291), the [[Reconquista]] (711\u20131492), the [[Battle of Lepanto]]
